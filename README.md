# Siamese-Network-with-Triplet-Loss-in-Keras

Created a Siamese Network and implemented Triplet Loss function using Python and Keras. It involved training the network with the Triplet Loss function to produce Embeddings of different classes from MNIST dataset, and used data generator to prepare the data for training.
